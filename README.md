# üß† Deep Learning Projects for Image Classification

This repository contains a collection of deep learning experiments implemented in Python using TensorFlow. The notebooks demonstrate image classification tasks, including digit recognition using MNIST and binary classification of cats vs. dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Download and install Miniconda (Python 3.6 version) for your operating system.

### 2. Create and Activate a Conda Environment

```bash
conda create --name dl-env python=3.6
conda activate dl-env
````

### 3. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python pickle-mixin notebook
```

## üì¶ Downloading MNIST Dataset

The MNIST dataset (images of handwritten digits) is automatically downloaded by TensorFlow when you run:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
```

No manual download is needed.

However, if you face any download issues (e.g., behind a proxy), you can manually fetch it from:

* [Yann LeCun's MNIST page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
* Place the four `.gz` files in a local directory, and use `tf.keras.utils.get_file` with a `file://` path to load them manually.

## üê±üê∂ Preparing Cats vs. Dogs Dataset

To run `2.ipynb`, place two folders named `Cat/` and `Dog/` in a parent directory (e.g., `Documents/`), each containing the respective images.

Update the `DATADIR` variable:

```python
DATADIR = "/path/to/Documents"
```

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle - Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) (requires Kaggle account).
